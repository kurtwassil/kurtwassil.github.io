# New Project Introduction Process

This document will provide details around the new project Introduction Process the Data Integration team will follow going forward.  This is a living document/process, meaning it may change as we learn from each project.

## Tasks:

* [Create Project Page](#project page)

* [Project Kick-Off](#kick-off)

* [Publish Project](#publish project)



## Project Page

An Epic will be created allowing us go group all story jira's to a single Project.  Before any project is started, a project page will be created in Confluence.  The Project page will be created by copying our [Project Template](https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1073873795).  There confluence page will contain the following pieces:

* Business Problem - What Business Problem are you solving?
* What - Are you trying to accomplish?
* When - Is the project to be made available (This is Project Deadline)?
* How - Will you complete the Project?
* Who - Will be involved with the project (These are resources to be included in Project Kick-Off Call)?
* Why - Are we working on this project?
* Target Audience - Who is this solution being targeted too?
* Deliverables - Specifically, what will this project deliver?
* Release Plan - How will this project be announced to target audience?
* List the Fix Version & Epic to be associated with each Jira

A report will be added to the bottom of the confluence page listing all the Jira's associated with the Epic.


## Kick-Off

Once the Confluence page and Epic are created, the next step is to schedule a project Kick-Off call.  All resources listed on the Confluence page will be invited to the Kick-Off call.

> ***This call should be recorded as it can be used for the Project Introduction Video you will share with everyone else on the team.***
>
> During the Kick-Off call, these are the activities that will occur:

* Review Project Confluence Page

* Answer any questions regarding scope and timeline of the project

* It is critical that before continuing EVERYONE on the call understand the project in great detail

* Identify all of the Tasks (Story Jiras) that will need to be completed.  (It is possible resources will need time to come up with specific tasks for their assigned areas)

* Assign Resources to each task

* Review Deadlines to each task

* Review Dependencies for each task

* Determine a Deadline for all Story Jira's to be created

* Expectations - Discuss any expectations you have.  

  *For example, if resources assigned to tasks are in different time zones, how should they communicate and coordinate work with each other.  What latitude do team members have to call meetings)*


Team members need to leave this call having 100% confidence in what the project is about and what their role in the project is, as well as the project deadline.


## Publish Project

After the Kick-Off call you should post the recording to the Project Confluence Page.  An e-mail should then be sent to the wider team so they are aware of the project.  The e-mail should contain the following items;

* Kick-Off Call Recording
* Link to the Project Confluence Page
